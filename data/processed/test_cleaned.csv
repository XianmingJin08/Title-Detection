"The overall gross profit percentage was 63% and 65% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Subscription and support gross profit increased $4.7 million, or 5%, compared to 2015. Professional services and other gross profit increased $1.5 million, or 139% compared to 2015. The increase in the number of professional service engagements has allowed for greater leverage of fixed costs, which has resulted in margin expansion for this revenue stream. The decrease in subscription and support gross margin is primarily related to additional costs incurred in delivering our subscription service in addition to the costs incurred to close certain facilities. During 2016 we moved certain operating activities to cloud-based services while maintaining existing data centers until the fourth quarter at which time we closed certain facilities and incurred an additional expense of $845,000. We expect to continue to seek opportunities to move operating activities to additional cloud-based services, and as a result, to achieve a moderate increase in subscription and support gross margin. It is likely that gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, will fluctuate quarter by quarter due to the timing and mix of subscription and support revenue and professional services and other revenue, and the type, timing and duration of service required in delivering certain projects.",0,0,0,-0.680825012392781,1.3236614173108892,-0.2093283123665785,-0.09849909703969109,0

"Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers' business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case, primarily in the North American economy, as well as our customers' inventory levels and available tractor and trailer capacity in the trucking industry. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight in the market and related pricing. Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads. Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers' business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, thus negatively impacting our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our structure proportionately with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions or facing credit issues could experience cash flow difficulties and, thus, represent a greater potential for payment delays or uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. Our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend credit to certain of these customers which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables.",0,0,0,0.7408145897980892,1.0296073130330607,-1.1328085929133322,0.6873992468939539,0

The ASU is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services. The standard is required to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract.

"The multiemployer plans to which ABF Freight contributes, which have been established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed (half of the trustees of each plan are selected by the participating employers, the other half by the IBT) and cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. Withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan pursuant to an agreement in a relatively short period of time. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan.",0,0,0,0.7408145897980892,1.0296073130330607,-1.1328085929133322,0.35383467647838757,0

The Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. In designing a specific hedging approach, FactSet considered several factors, including offsetting exposures, the significance of exposures, the forecasting of risk and the potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts offset the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements. The changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of AOCL and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings. There was no discontinuance of cash flow hedges during fiscal 2016 or 2015, and as such, no corresponding gains or losses related to changes in the value of the Company's contracts were reclassified into earnings prior to settlement.",0,0,0,-0.6594469732620913,1.3199486129639468,-1.0101548755191867,-0.8904622513445284,0

"The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in the law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.

"For those marketed products which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including ""covered entities"" purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. One component of the rebate and discount calculations under the Medicaid and 340B programs, respectively, is the ""additional rebate"", a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the rate at which a branded drug price increases over time more than the rate of inflation (based on the CPI-U). This comparison is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug's NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer. This ""additional rebate"" calculation can, in some cases where price increase have been relatively high versus the first quarter of sales of the NDA, result in Medicaid rebates up to 100% of a drug's ""average manufacturer price"" and 340B prices of one penny.

"Sales in the Aerospace OEM business are based on the general state of the aerospace market driven by the worldwide economy and are supported by its order backlog through participation in certain strategic commercial and military engine and airframe programs. Over the next several years, the Company expects strength in demand for new engines, driven by an expected increase in commercial aircraft production levels. The Company sees 2016 as having been a transition year for the Aerospace OEM business as it moves from declining production on some of its legacy engine programs onto the ramping of several new engine programs. Backlog at OEM was $626.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of 11.1% since December 31, 2015, at which time backlog was $563.9 million. Approximately 50% of OEM backlog is expected to ship in the next 12 months. The Aerospace OEM business may be impacted by changes in the content levels on certain platforms, changes in customer sourcing decisions, adjustments to customer inventory levels, commodity availability and pricing, changes in production schedules of specific engine and airframe programs, redesign of parts, quantity of parts per engine, cost schedules agreed to under contract with the engine manufacturers, as well as the pursuit and duration of new programs. Sales in the Aerospace aftermarket business may be impacted by fluctuations in end-market demand, inventory management and changes in customer sourcing, deferred or limited maintenance activity during engine shop visits and the use of surplus (used) material during the engine repair and overhaul process. End markets are expected to grow based on the long term underlying fundamentals of the aerospace industry. Management continues to believe its Aerospace aftermarket business is competitively positioned based on well-established long-term customer relationships, including maintenance and repair contracts in the MRO business and long-term Revenue Sharing Programs (""RSPs"") and Component Repair Programs (""CRPs""), expanded capabilities and current capacity levels. Fluctuations in fuel costs and their impact on airline profitability and behaviors within the aerospace industry could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies.",0,0,0,-0.680825012392781,1.3236614173108892,-0.022281393340506536,0.2992513831376585,0

"Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and in the foreign countries in which they are sold. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the United States must receive either 510(k) clearance or premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA before the product can be sold. Either process can be lengthy and expensive. The FDA's 510(k) clearance procedure, also known as ""premarket notification,"" is the process we have used for our current products. This process usually takes from four to 12 months from the date the premarket notification is submitted to the FDA, but may take significantly longer. Although we have obtained 510(k) clearances for our current products, our clearances may be revoked by the FDA if safety or effectiveness problems develop with the devices. The PMA process is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years from the date the application is submitted to, and filed with, the FDA, and may take even longer. Regulatory regimes in other countries similarly require approval or clearance prior to our marketing or selling products in those countries.

"We are engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs that treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders by modulating the effects of the hormone cortisol. Elevated levels and abnormal release patterns of cortisol are implicated in a broad range of human disorders. Since our inception in 1998, we have been developing mifepristone, a compound that modulates the effects of cortisol by acting as a competitive antagonist at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We have also discovered three structurally distinct series of proprietary, selective cortisol modulators, all of which share mifepristone's affinity for GR but, unlike mifepristone, do not bind to the progesterone receptor and so do not cause effects associated with progesterone receptor antagonism.

"Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $105.2 million during 2015 in comparison to 2014. Changes in foreign exchange rates during 2015 decreased Selling, general, and administrative expenses by $111.3 million. An overall decrease in acquisition integration costs and the positive benefit of restructuring actions to reduce structural costs and integrate acquisitions also contributed to the decrease. These items were partially offset by a $40.4 million acquisition- related increase in Selling, general and administrative expense during 2015. Additionally, Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 includes an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of specific South American customers of approximately $9 million, asset impairment charges of $4.3 million, and transaction costs and year-one amortization of approximately $8 million related to acquisitions in our gas and fluid handling segment. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales increased primarily as a result of lower Net sales driven by reasons discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 includes a $13.4 million impairment loss related to identifiable intangible assets, a $4.0 million loss on disposition of a small fluid handling business line and a $6.3 million loss from the use of the SICAD II exchange rate at our Venezuelan businesses.

"The Company may seek in the future to distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and common shares, at the election of each shareholder. Taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of the Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, shareholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the common shares that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of common shares at the time of the sale. In addition, in such case, a U.S. shareholder could have a capital loss with respect to the common shares sold that could not be used to offset such dividend income. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. shareholders, the Company may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common shares. In addition, such a taxable share dividend could be viewed as equivalent to a reduction in the Company's cash distributions, and that factor, as well as the possibility that a significant number of the Company's shareholders could determine to sell the common shares in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, may put downward pressure on the market price of the Company's common shares.",0,0,0,-0.680825012392781,0.3991731349222614,-0.9457616738872603,-0.6599994572392279,0

"Moreover, on January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing all executive agencies, including the FDA, that, for each notice of proposed rulemaking or final regulation to be issued in fiscal year 2017, the agency shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed, unless prohibited by law. These requirements are referred to as the ""two-for-one"" provisions. This Executive Order includes a budget neutrality provision that requires the total incremental cost of all new regulations in the 2017 fiscal year, including repealed regulations, to be no greater than zero, except in limited circumstances. For fiscal years 2018 and beyond, the Executive Order requires agencies to identify regulations to offset any incremental cost of a new regulation. In interim guidance issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB on February 2, 2017, the administration indicates that the ""two-for-one"" provisions may apply not only to agency regulations, but also to significant agency guidance documents. It is difficult to predict how these requirements will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA's ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose restrictions on FDA's ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted. Similarly, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may place at risk the FDA marketing approval for Korlym and any other marketing approval that we may obtain, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to sustain profitability.",0,0,0,-0.680825012392781,1.3251465390496664,-1.1573393363921614,-0.9389807343140653,0

"On January 2, 2015, the Company and its lenders entered into an agreement to amend and restate the credit agreement (the ""Amended and Restated Credit Agreement""). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement refinanced a $70.0 million term loan, which was outstanding under the Company's previous credit agreement at December 31, 2014, with a revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit Facility, which matures on January 2, 2020, has an initial maximum credit amount of $150.0 million including a swing line facility and a letter of credit sub-facility providing for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $20.0 million. The Credit Facility allows the Company to request additional revolving commitments or incremental term loans thereunder up to an aggregate additional amount of $75.0 million, subject to certain additional conditions as provided in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Principal payments under the Credit Facility are due upon maturity; however, borrowings may be repaid, at the Company's discretion, in whole or in part at any time, without penalty, subject to required notice periods and compliance with minimum prepayment amounts. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement can either be, at the Company's election: (i) at the alternate base rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus a spread; or (ii) at the Eurodollar rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus a spread. The applicable spread is dependent upon the Company's adjusted leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains conditions, representations and warranties, events of default, and indemnification provisions that are customary for financings of this type, including, but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, certain sale and leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, purchases and sales of assets, and certain restricted payments.

"Sales of equipment and replacement parts are recorded by the Company when title and risks of ownership have been transferred to an independent dealer, distributor or other customer. In certain countries, sales of certain grain storage and protein production systems in which the Company is responsible for construction or installation and which may be contingent upon customer acceptance, are recorded on an over-time basis, using a percentage of completion method. Payment terms vary by market and product, with fixed payment schedules on all sales. The terms of sale generally require that a purchase order or order confirmation accompany all shipments. Title generally passes to the dealer or distributor upon shipment or specified delivery, and the risk of loss upon damage, theft or destruction of the equipment is the responsibility of the dealer, distributor or third-party carrier at the point of the stated shipping or delivery term. In certain foreign countries, the Company retains a form of title to goods delivered to dealers until the dealer makes payment so that the Company can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment. This occurs as the laws of some foreign countries do not provide for a seller's retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the United States Uniform Commercial Code. The only right the Company retains with respect to the title is that enabling recovery of the goods in the event of customer default on payment. The dealer or distributor may not return equipment or replacement parts while its contract with the Company is in force.

In 2015, our Asset-Based segment began voluntarily installing aerodynamic aids on its fleet of over-the-road trailers to further enhance fuel economy and reduce emissions. In 2006, ABF Freight was accepted in the EPA's SmartWay Transport Partnership, a collaboration between the EPA and the freight transportation industry that helps freight shippers, carriers, and logistics companies reduce greenhouse gases and diesel emissions. In recognition of ABF Freight's industry leadership in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency, the EPA's SmartWay Transport Partnership awarded ABF Freight a SmartWay Excellence Award in 2014.

The new guidance did not result in retrospective adjustments to the consolidated financial statements or disclosures.",0,0,0,0.7408145897980892,1.030349873902449,-0.2491907705196757,-0.2349573303915137,0
"During the fourth quarter of 2015, upon finalizing its 2016 property level budgets, the Company identified indicators of impairment at its Renaissance hotel in New York, New York, due to declines in the current and forecasted operations of the property. The Company performed a test of recoverability and determined that the carrying value of the hotel exceeded its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The shortfall in estimated cash flows was triggered by a combination of (a) declines in existing and forecasted hotel market conditions in New York, (b) new supply in the market and (c) the loss of retail tenants at the property and the extended period of time it has taken and is estimated that it will take to re-lease the available space. The cost of transitioning to a new management company during 2015, increases in real estate taxes and the remaining term on the property's ground lease impacted the shortfall. Upon concluding that the carrying cost exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company adjusted the carrying value of the hotel (approximately $86 million) to its estimated fair market value (approximately $41 million), resulting in an impairment loss of approximately $45.0 million. The Company engaged a third party to assist with the analysis of the fair market value. The fair market value of the hotel was estimated by using the income and market approaches as outlined under ASC 820, using both observable market data (Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy) and unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions and calculations (Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy). Under the income approach, the fair value estimate was calculated from a discounted cash flow analysis, using expected future cash flows based on stabilized room revenue growth rates of 1% to 4%, an estimated discount rate of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%, estimated terminal capitalization rate of 7% and other market considerations.",0,0,0,-0.680825012392781,0.4058561827467578,-0.255834513545192,0.15925534373597386,0

"As one of the key elements of our clinical development strategy, we seek to identify patient subsets within a disease category who may derive selective and meaningful benefit from the product candidates we are developing. In collaboration with partners, we plan to develop companion diagnostics to help us to more accurately identify patients within a particular subset, both during our clinical trials and in connection with the commercialization of our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We do not develop companion diagnostics internally and thus we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of our third-party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. We and our collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for the companion diagnostics, including issues relating to selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation. Any delay or failure by our collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates. In addition, our collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostics, and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostics in the clinical community. If such companion diagnostics fail to gain market acceptance, it would have an adverse effect on our ability to derive revenues from sales of our products. In addition, the diagnostic company with whom we contract may decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the companion diagnostic that we anticipate using in connection with development and commercialization of our product candidates or our relationship with such diagnostic company may otherwise terminate. We may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and/or delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates.",0,0,0,0.7319070734936352,1.027008349990201,-1.065860105502361,-0.7216583626796811,0

"Hotel operating expense consists of direct room operating expense, hotel administrative expense, sales and marketing expense, utilities expense, repair and maintenance expense, franchise fees and management fees. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, hotel operating expense totaled $582.8 million and $507.1 million or 56.0% and 56.4% of total revenue for each respective period. Overall hotel operational expenses for 2016 include the results of the 56 hotels acquired in the Apple Ten merger for the last four months of the year, one hotel acquired on July 1, 2016 from the date of acquisition, the results of the seven hotels acquired between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015 for the full year, and the results of one hotel sold on December 6, 2016 until the date of sale. Expenses for 2015 include the results of the 19 hotels sold in 2015 until the respective dates of sale and the seven hotels acquired in 2015 from their respective dates of acquisition. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, hotel operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased approximately 20 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the overall increase in ADR for these hotels, favorable utility costs and the relatively fixed nature of certain operating costs such as management costs, certain utility costs and minimum supply and maintenance costs, which decline as a percentage of revenue as revenue increases, partially offset by increasing labor costs. The Company anticipates labor costs are likely to grow at increased rates due to government regulations surrounding wages, healthcare and other benefits and other government-related initiatives, such as the ""living wage"" increase, which could negatively impact operating expenses in certain markets moving forward. Additionally, labor costs have been and could be impacted in certain markets due to lower unemployment rates. With less qualified available labor, costs have increased. Although operating expenses will increase as revenue increases, the Company will continue to work with its management companies to reduce costs as a percentage of revenue where possible while maintaining quality and service levels at each property.",0,0,0,-0.680825012392781,0.4036285001385923,-1.2222435951798967,0.7141854927000525,0

"We operate in highly competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors' efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue make investments to innovate and manufacture the types of products demanded by our customers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in increasing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins.
