In the second quarter of 2016, we began a Phase 2 trial of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator, CORT125134, to treat patients with Cushing syndrome.

"Additionally, for its existing portfolio, the Company monitors each property's profitability, market conditions and capital requirements and attempts to maximize shareholder value by disposing of properties when it believes that superior value can be provided by the proceeds from the sale of the property. As a result, during the third quarter of 2016, the Company identified two properties for potential sale (its 224-room Hilton hotel in Dallas, Texas and its 226-room Marriott hotel in Chesapeake, Virginia), and in October 2016, the Company entered into separate contracts for the sale of these properties. Due to the change in the anticipated hold period for each of these hotels, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $5.5 million during the third quarter of 2016 to adjust the basis of the Chesapeake, Virginia Marriott to its estimated fair value. In December 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Chesapeake, Virginia Marriott, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.2 million, which is included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Dallas, Texas Hilton was under contract to be sold for approximately $56.1 million and was classified as held for sale in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Under the contract, at closing, which is expected to be during the first half of 2017, the mortgage loan secured by the Dallas, Texas Hilton hotel with an outstanding balance of approximately $27.2 million as of December 31, 2016 will be assumed by the buyer with the buyer receiving a credit for the amount assumed. The sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, and therefore the operating results of these properties are included in income from continuing operations for the three years ended December 31, 2016. The proceeds from the sales were or will be used to pay down borrowings on the Company's $540 million revolving credit facility.

"Historically, the Company employed a total return on investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments were used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Because of volatility in market returns and the plan's current funding status, the decision was made in 2014 to move towards a liability driven investing strategy whereby the assets are primarily fixed income investments. The fixed income investments that were chosen under this strategy, while not precisely the same, are meant to parallel the investments selected in determining the discount rate used to calculate the Company's pension liability. In November 2016, the Company further modified the investment policy to attain a portfolio that consists of intermediate and short-duration investment grade bonds along with a mid-duration long credit fund. At year end, the Company was in the process of implementing this investment policy to meet its target portfolio. The objective of this strategy is to maintain the funding status of the plan by eliminating equity exposure and minimizing interest rate risk. The remaining equity securities at year-end were diversified across various investment categories. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability studies.",0,0,0,-0.680825012392781,0.3898911240549057,-0.48274389072436114,-0.24759235199816396,0
"The historical rates of return for the Company's defined benefit plans were calculated based upon compounded average rates of return of published indices. The target mix reflects a 65% equity investment target and a 35% target for fixed income and cash investments (in aggregate). The equity investment of 65% is more heavily on global equity investment targets, rather than U.S. targets.

"We conduct business outside the U.S. in several currencies including the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and Philippine Peso. The financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. Over the next 12 months, our non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized are estimated to be $20.0 million while our non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses are $213.3 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of $193.3 million per year. To the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. To manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we utilize derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts). By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution. Further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties.

"The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 25.7% in 2016 compared with 23.2% in 2015. The increase in the 2016 effective tax rate from continuing operations is primarily due to the expiration of certain tax holidays, the absence of the 2015 refund of withholding taxes and the change in the mix of earnings attributable to higher-taxing jurisdictions, partially offset by lower repatriation of a portion of current year foreign earnings to the U.S and the excess tax benefit on stock awards, reflecting the amended guidance related to share-based payments made to employees. See Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2016, the Company repatriated a dividend from a portion of the current year foreign earnings to the U.S. in the amount of $8.3 million compared to $19.5 million in 2015.

Such risks include greater risk of joint venture partners or other investors failing to meet their obligations under related stockholders' agreements; conflicts with joint venture partners; the possibility of a joint venture partner taking valuable knowledge from the Company; and risk of being denied access to the capital markets, which could lead to resource demands on the Company in order to maintain or advance its strategy.

"Liabilities for self-insured workers' compensation and third-party casualty claims are based on the case-basis reserve amounts plus an estimate of loss development and incurred but not reported (""IBNR"") claims, which is developed from an independent actuarial analysis.

Earnings Per Share: The Company uses the two-class method for calculating earnings per share due to certain equity awards being deemed participating securities. The two-class method is an earnings allocation method under which earnings per share is calculated for each class of common stock and participating security considering both dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. The calculation uses the net income based on the two-class method and the weighted-average number of common shares (basic earnings per share) or common equivalent shares outstanding (diluted earnings per share) during the applicable period. The dilutive effect of common stock equivalents is excluded from basic earnings per common share and included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share.,0,0,0,0.7408145897980892,1.029978593467755,-0.15106779660435937,-0.08940188148290286,0

"The Asset-Based segment represented approximately 70% of our 2016 total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations.

The ABF NMFA included a 7% wage rate reduction effective on the November 3, 2013 implementation date, followed by wage rate increases of 2% on July 1 in each of the next three years, which began in 2014, and a 2.5% increase on July 1, 2017; a one-week reduction in annual compensated vacation effective for employee anniversary dates on or after April 1, 2013; the option to expand the use of purchased transportation; and increased flexibility in labor work rules.

"In 2014, we adopted new U.S. mortality tables for purposes of determining our mortality assumption used in the U.S. defined benefit plans' liability calculation. The new assumptions were based on the Society of Actuaries' recent mortality experience study and reflected future mortality improvements based on the Social Security's expectations. In 2015 and 2016, the the Society of Actuaries released new mortality improvement projection scales. As a result, we again updated U.S. mortality improvement assumptions in 2015 and 2016 for purposes of determining our mortality assumption used in the U.S. defined benefit plans' liability calculation. For the 2016 year end, we moved to the Society of Actuaries mortality improvement scale for improvements beyond the measurement date.

"As of August 31, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $8.8 million, including $1.3 million of accrued interest, recorded as Taxes Payable (non-current) within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. When applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled. If recognized, the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. For this reason, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

Under the standard, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, resulting in an impairment charge that is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The impairment charge, however, should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. The impairment assessment under ASU 2017-04 applies to all reporting units, including those with a zero or negative carrying amount. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods using a prospective approach.

"In March 2016, the FASB amended its guidance related to the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The amended guidance requires that all tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement, rather than through equity. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The amended guidance also allows for an employer to repurchase additional employee shares for tax withholding purposes without requiring liability accounting and clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The guidance also allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than accounting for them on an estimated basis.

"The Asset-Based segment 2016 operating ratio increased by 1.5 percentage points to 98.2% from 96.7% in 2015. Improving the Asset-Based operating ratio is dependent upon: managing the segment's cost structure (as discussed in the Labor Costs section of the Asset-Based Segment Overview of Results of Operations) and securing price increases to cover contractual wage and benefit rate increases, costs of maintaining customer service levels, and other inflationary increases in cost elements. The operating ratio increase was impacted by pressure from lower weight per shipment on higher shipments as well as higher claims for nonunion healthcare and increased workers' compensation and third-party casualty claims costs. Tonnage per day increased a modest 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016, but that increase was preceded by five consecutive quarters of year-over-year tonnage declines while the number of shipments increased. This trend of lower weight per shipment, which is more fully described in the preceding paragraphs, was comparable to the reported experience of many LTL carriers during 2016. Since revenue for each shipment is typically determined by applying a price, which considers profile characteristics of the shipment, to the weight of the shipment, this trend has had a negative impact on revenue per shipment while still requiring operating resources (including labor and, in certain markets, local purchased transportation agents) to handle higher numbers of shipments. For the full year of 2016, shipments increased 2.3% per day while daily tonnage declined 1.8%, leading to lower weight per shipment and consequently lower revenue per shipment. Operating income decreased to $33.6 million in 2016 compared to $62.4 million in 2015. The operating income comparison was impacted by the freight profile shift previously discussed, market factors, including the weak freight tonnage environment and related competitive pricing, and increases in nonunion healthcare costs and third-party casualty and workers' compensation claims costs. Nonunion healthcare costs increased $5.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Third-party casualty claims costs and workers' compensation costs, while in-line with the segment's ten-year historical average as a percentage of revenue, increased a combined $5.4 million, and 0.3% as a percentage of revenue in 2016 compared to 2015.

"In October 2016, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its 224-room Hilton hotel in Dallas, Texas, which was terminated in November 2016. In December 2016, the Company entered into a new purchase and sale agreement for a gross sales price of approximately $56.1 million, as amended.

"Currently, our largest foreign currency exposures are the euro and British pound, primarily because our European operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses.

"The discount rate is determined by matching projected cash distributions with the appropriate high-quality corporate bond yields in a yield curve analysis to arrive at a single weighted-average rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments to their present value. A lower discount rate results in an increase in the projected benefit obligation when the liability is remeasured (at December 31 of each year or upon settlement at each quarter-end, if applicable). A quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase annual nonunion pension expense, before pension settlement expense, by less than $0.1 million on a pre-tax basis. We establish the expected rate of return on plan assets by considering the historical returns for the plan's current investment mix and the plan investment advisor's range of expected returns for the plan's current investment mix. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents a long-term assumption of the plan's portfolio performance, and we can make no assurance that the rate will be achieved. A decrease in expected returns on plan assets increases nonunion pension expense.

In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. If contamination is discovered on the Company's properties, environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which the properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. Moreover, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner's ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property on favorable terms or at all.
